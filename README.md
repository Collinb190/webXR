# **Web-Based AR with WebXR**

Get ready to redefine how people interact with AR and unlock a new realm of possibilities on the web!

---

## **Background Context**

Augmented reality (AR) is a powerful way to engage users, but creating an app can introduce friction—**91% of users dislike being forced to install apps.** Many people will either avoid downloading an app or uninstall it shortly after.

What if you could deliver AR experiences seamlessly through the web, accessible with just a browser?

In this project, you will explore how to create immersive AR experiences using **WebXR** and **three.js**, eliminating the need for dedicated apps. By the end, you'll have the skills to design, implement, and share your own web-based AR applications.

## **Technical Description**

This project leverages **Google’s WebXR** and the open-source JavaScript library **three.js** to create web-based AR experiences. Here's what you'll focus on:

### **1. Understanding Web-Based AR**
- Learn the fundamentals of WebXR and compare it to Google’s ARCore.
- Gain hands-on experience through tutorials.

### **2. Web-Based AR Implementation**
- Develop a custom AR experience accessible via web browsers.
- Ensure easy sharing through links or QR codes for a seamless user experience.

### **3. Application of Web-Based AR**
- Reimagine a business card as an engaging AR experience, offering an innovative way to present professional information.

### **4. Hosting and Sharing AR Experiences**
- Host your WebXR application on **GitHub Pages**, making it easily shareable.

### **5. Expanding Creative Horizons**
- Design a unique AR-based user experience that highlights both technical and creative skills.
